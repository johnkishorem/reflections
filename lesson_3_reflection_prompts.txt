When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   When multiple people on the same project
   When we want to share our work
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   It can save bandwidth
   It gives complete control over the local repo
